# PART III
## THE POLITICS OF AVOWAL AND DISAVOWAL

> We do not act because we know.
> We know because we are called upon to act.

The final two chapters engage directly with the politics of free software. Chapter 5 examines the politics of avowal and popular protest, and the conclusion looks at the disavowal of broadly conceived politics among many free software hackers.

Chapter 5 explores two different conditions under which free software developers learn about the law. It contrasts everyday legal pedagogy as it unfolds in Debian with a lively series of political protests, which I describe as a moment of political avowal because of the way hackers and program- mers took to the streets between 1999 and 2003 to insist on their free speech rights to create as well as circulate software unencumbered by current legal restrictions. During this period, F/OSS hackers enunciated more re exively than ever before their free speech rights to produce and distribute software, thereby working to stabilize a relatively new cultural claim in which source code came to be imagined as a species of free speech.


In contrast to this period of lively political protest, the conclusion ex- amines what I consistently witnessed during my  eldwork: a reluctance to signify free software beyond a narrow politics of software freedom. I start by discussing how and why this is articulated, but quickly move on to look at the consequence of this political disavowal. A central feature of F/OSS has been its political agnosticism, which has facilitated, I argue, its spread and adoption, allowing it to attain a position where it can circulate widely and perform a political message. Through its visibility and its use by mul- tiple publics, F/OSS thus makes apparent the assumptions that dominate the moral landscape of intellectual property law and mainstream economic theory. An important element here is the transposability of F/OSS, or its power to enjoin others to become part of its performance in various ways— through the use of F/OSS artifacts and licenses, participation in projects, re-  ections on the larger meaning of collaboration, and the recon gurations of licenses for other nontechnological objects. Its most profound political effect has been to devitalize the hegemonic status of intellectual property law and catalyze a series of transformations in the arena of intellectual property law.
