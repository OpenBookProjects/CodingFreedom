## CODES OF VALUE

Anthropologists often focus on cultural value—those ethical, aesthetic, and political attributes of social life that a group has come to deem im- portant, and that ultimately help de ne it as distinct from other groups. The next two chapters tackle the question of cultural value as a starting point to address a host of questions about hacker technical and cultural production along with the tensions that mark hackers’ social dynamics, collaborative practices, and organizational forms.

Although we might be able to identify some indisputable commitments among hackers, such as meritocracy and the form of individualism it entails, the foundation of value among hackers is never without dispute and fric- tion. Indeed, hacking, like all social domains, is shot through with a series of notable tensions. These oscillate between individualism and collectivism, elitism and humility, and frustration and deep pleasure, among others. There are various codes—informal and formal—by which hackers negotiate the tensions that characterize their productive landscape.

The next two chapters attend to what hackers value as well as the ten- sions that are part and parcel of hacking, and the social codes by which these tensions are partially resolved. Chapter 3 will examine the pragmatic and aesthetic demands of writing code. Humor  gures prominently since it mirrors the formal/pragmatic and poetic/aesthetic dimensions of coding, and gets us closer to the most palpable tension in the hacker world—that between individualism and collectivism, which is necessary to grasp notions of creativity and authorship.

Chapter 4 steps away from the craft and aesthetics of hacking toward the workshop where hacking now unfolds—the free software project. Focusing on the Debian project, I continue to give attention to the central contra- dictions that mark hacking, notably that between elitism and populism. A new thread concerning ethical commitments to information freedom and free speech also appears. Free software projects, while most famous as the place where technical coordination unfolds, is also where signi cant ethical work transpires. It is here where commitments to free speech are inculcated, thorny issues of meritocracies are resolved, and hackers embody and live out a dense ethical practice.
